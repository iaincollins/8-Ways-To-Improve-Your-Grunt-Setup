## Warthogs >= bacon dripped in gravy wrapped around a leg of awesome

OMG our jobs have become so much harder than they were before.  Remember when you could build a site with just 1 HTML, 1 CSS and 1 JS file?

    * Our jobs have become REALLY hard, but grunt.js to the rescue!
    * Point at the ultimate-gruntfile project on github
    * Don't be a stupid trooper, don't just copy and insert the grunt setup into your project.  Pick and choose the right bits for what you need

We're not going to talk you through what each task does, there's this thing called The Google that allows you to do your own research.  Instead we will chat about four main principles you need to stick to when using grunt:

* Keep the gruntfile maintainable
* Keep grunt running fast
* Use grunt to speed up your development workflow
* Use grunt to make your site faster

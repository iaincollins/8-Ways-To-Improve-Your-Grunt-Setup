Remember when you could build a site with just 1 HTML, 1 CSS and 1 JS file?  #happyDays Our jobs have become incredibly complex, the number of browsers we support is ridiculous, performance best practices are hard to keep up with, even writing CSS has become a chore!

Luckily there are now build tools to help us manage this complexity, popular tools like Grunt and Gulp have tremendous community support and are very easy to use.  Unfortunately, they themselves become complex when you start using them in earnest.

Mark and Tom have been using Grunt for over a year, using it to manage the codebase that powers BBC News.  There are 3 main principles you need to stick to when using Grunt:

* Keep the `Gruntfile` maintainable
* Keep Grunt running fast
* Use Grunt to speed up your development workflow

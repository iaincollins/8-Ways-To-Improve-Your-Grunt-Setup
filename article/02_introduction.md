## Warthogs >= bacon dripped in gravy wrapped around a leg of awesome

OMG our jobs have become so much harder than they were before.  Remember when you could build a site with just 1 HTML, 1 CSS and 1 JS file?

* Our jobs have become REALLY hard, but here comes Grunt to the rescue!
* [The Ultimate Gruntfile GitHub repo](https://github.com/BBC-News/The-Ultimate-Gruntfile/tree/master/project)
* Don't be a stupid trooper, don't just copy and insert the grunt setup into your project.  Understand the 'why' and the 'how' so you can pick and choose the right tools for the job

We're not going to talk you through what each task does, there's this thing called The Google that allows you to do your own research.  Instead we will chat about four main principles you need to stick to when using Grunt:

* Keep the `Gruntfile` maintainable
* Keep Grunt running fast
* Use Grunt to speed up your development workflow
* Use Grunt to make your site faster

## Understand what each task does

The biggest criticism of Grunt is that its slow.  While Grunt does have some sub-optimal design decisions in it (which are being addressed in Grunt v1.0), a Grunt setup overloaded with tasks is obviously going to run slowly.

For a project I recently worked on, we added a 90Kb data file for D3.js to compile into a map.  This caused our grunt build to take over 2 minutes to render a concatenated JS file via [grunt-contrib-requirejs](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-requirejs) - not a great time to wait between saves.  The build took this long because [grunt-contrib-requirejs] was creating a JS sourcemap for the concatenated file, a fruitless task for a data file with thousands of points.  Blacklisting the data file brought the build back down to a few seconds.

Ultimately, the best way to keep your Grunt.js setup maintainable, fast and scaleable is to understand what you are doing.  Keep reading about Grunt.js; follow thought leaders like Ben Altman (@cowboy - the creator of Grunt.js), Sindre Sorhus (@sindresorhus - node.js superstar) and Addy Osmani (@addyosmani - workflow enthusiast) instead of blindly 'copy and paste'ing code into your project.  Keep learning.

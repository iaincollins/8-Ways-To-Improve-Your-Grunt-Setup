## Speed up your development workflow

Along with keeping your Gruntfile maintainable, the next biggest improvement you can make to your usage of Grunt is to have it help you improve your workflow; to help automate those tedious parts of your development day.

Here are a few Grunt tasks you probably should be using:

- [grunt-contrib-watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch)
- [grunt-newer](https://github.com/tschaub/grunt-newer)
- [grunt-responsive-images](https://github.com/andismith/grunt-responsive-images)
- [grunt-contrib-uglify](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify)
- [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding)

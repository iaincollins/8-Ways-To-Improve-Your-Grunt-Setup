## You don't need Grunt

Whoa there! Say that again? Yup, you read that right the first time. There are other alternatives and depending on your requirements you might be better off not using Grunt at all.

So what options do we have?

- npm (https://www.npmjs.org/)
- gulp (http://gulpjs.com/)
- Plumber (https://github.com/plumberjs/plumber#plumber)
- Fez (http://fez.github.io/)
- Many more tools built in not only JavaScript, but Ruby, Python, and even just bare bones shell scripting can sometimes work.

We've not much time so let's take a super brief look at the first two options (as *currently* they're the two most popular - and important - alternatives).

Yes, npm (the Node Package Manager - and where all your Grunt packages are stored) can in its rawest from be used as a build tool. Inside the package.json file where you typically define your dependencies for a Grunt project you can also set a `script` property which points to an object. This object lets you define tasks that can be run (these tasks can be scripts written in Node or just using raw shell commands).

You may have heard a rumbling on the internet about gulp.js but not understood why? It is a task runner very similar to Grunt but the difference lies in implementation. gulp is built around Node Streams which are designed to be extremely efficient with resources by pushing chunks of data to its next destination as early as feasible, rather than buffering up all the content and then sending it on in one hit (which is how Grunt *currently* works - although there are plans to switch to Streams in the future).

The other aspect to gulp is that it is more about the code than configuration. Grunt is based around the premise of providing a configuration file that lets you define your tasks; where as gulp is for users more comfortable writing code nearer the Node level. Both have their pros and cons and are useful in different scenarios. If you want to see an example then take a look at: https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/#sample-gulpfile

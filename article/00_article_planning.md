The Ultimate Gruntfile - by BBC News' Mark McDonnell and Tom Maslen

The great irony of our jobs today is that to make a site as fast as possible takes longer than ever before.  Our jobs have become hard, really hard!  Grunt.js has quickly become an industry standard build tool, helping us to keep up with the latest development best practices, but making grunt do all the things is hard.  This article and its accompanying open source github project will give you a starting point for all your future projects.  Go from grunt beginner to grunt pro as you learn the tips and tricks that Mark and Tom learnt the hard way while using grunt to build BBC News' responsive website.

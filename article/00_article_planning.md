This article will take you from grunt beginner to grunt pro, teaching you how to structure your grunt project to make it maintainable, fast running and helping you to be able to focus on building great websites, whilst allowing you to forget about the tediousness of configuring tools required to automate and develop modern day websites and applications.

The Ultimate Gruntfile - by BBC News' Mark McDonnell and Tom Maslen

The great irony of our jobs today, with all the technological advances - HTML5, ES5/6, CSS3, pre-processors and tools that compile practically any language you can think of down to JavaScript; tools designed to help improve our development speed and efficiency - is that to make a site as fast as possible actually takes longer than ever before.  Our jobs have become hard, really hard!

In the world of 'task management' Grunt.js has quickly become an industry standard, helping us to automate a lot of the tools we use to build our sites, run our tests and to help keep us up to date with the latest development best practices. But making grunt do all these things can be difficult and confusing.  This article and its accompanying open source github project will give you a starting point for all your future projects.  You'll go from grunt beginner to grunt pro as you learn the tips and tricks that Mark and Tom have learnt the hard way while using grunt to build the BBC News responsive website.

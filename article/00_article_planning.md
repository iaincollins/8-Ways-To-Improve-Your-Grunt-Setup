# 8 ways to improve your Grunt setup

main: 1,550 words

A list of improvements to make to your Grunt setup.  We'll write as much as we can, order everything by how relevant we think each section is and then we'll cut the list down to make the article fit the word count.

Some notes:

* 6 images are required still
* We could drop the intro and conclusion if its now a listicle?
* We could change the boxouts to be sections?
* We currently have 12 sections so we need to cut at least 33%
* The code examples are taking up too much word count
* Project to do list:
  * Setup all tasks to only register tasks when ran
  * Make sure it all works

These are part of the discarded section "Use grunt to make your site faster".  This could be a separate article all by itself.

## Synopsis / pitch

The Ultimate Gruntfile - by BBC News' Mark McDonnell and Tom Maslen

The great irony of our jobs today, with all the technological advances - HTML5, ES5/6, CSS3, pre-processors and tools that compile practically any language you can think of down to JavaScript; tools designed to help improve our development speed and efficiency - is that to make a site as fast as possible actually takes longer than ever before.  Our jobs have become hard, really hard!

In the world of 'task management' Grunt.js has quickly become an industry standard, helping us to automate a lot of the tools we use to build our sites, run our tests and to help keep us up to date with the latest development best practices. But making grunt do all these things can be difficult and confusing.  This article and its accompanying open source github project will give you a starting point for all your future projects.  You'll go from grunt beginner to grunt pro as you learn the tips and tricks that Mark and Tom have learnt the hard way while using grunt to build the BBC News responsive website.

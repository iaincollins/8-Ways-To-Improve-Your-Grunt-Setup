## The best tool for the right job

OK, time for an analogy... "it's not the clothes, it's the man". 

If you're not already ulterly confused let me clarify... Grunt is just the clothes on top of Node.js - it's what Node wears when it's the weekend and it's ready to do some training (not when it's off to do its day job). But you need to wash those sweaty old training shorts every once in a while! That's what we've been doing here today, looking at what smells we've found and cleaning them up.

Let's recap what we've looked at:

* Split up your tasks into individual files
* Organise those files!
* Only load what you need, when you actually need it
* Consider alternatives such as gulp if they cater more to your specific needs
* Small project? Just need some light configurating? Grunt
* Can't find a Grunt or gulp task that does what you need?  Write your own native Node script/task

Task runners such as Grunt are an essential tool to keep you focused on the job at hand: developing an awesome website/web application. They're designed to abstract away the tedious pain points of setting up a new project, so if you're not taking care of these tools they will come back and bite you in the ass. It's good to show them a little love and appreciation, so we hope that the tips we've shared with you today will help you keep your own warthog happily grunting along!

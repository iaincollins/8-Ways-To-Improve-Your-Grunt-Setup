## The best tool for the right job

There are parallels between grunt and grunt tasks with jquery and jquery plugins.  Its the underlying language that is useful, but the library (jQuery / Grunt) is an easy way in.
It's not the tool that is awesome, its what the tool does:
	* Default is grunt.js
	* Writing lots of code, defining mini tasks and moving files around?  Take a hard look at gulp.js
	* Small project, just need config?  Grunt.js
	* Can't find a grunt or gulp task that does what you need?  Write a native node task
